# In-Game Config

## Mod Config Menu

In the **Mod Config Menu**, I recommend these options:

**Improved Vanilla Levelling:** DISABLE Retroactive Health Calculation
**Map and Compass:** Optionally select map
**PvP:** Increase attack frequency of enemies -> No

## Settings

**Character Sound Overhaul:** The author recommends you set the Footsteps volume to minimum in your in-game audio settings.
