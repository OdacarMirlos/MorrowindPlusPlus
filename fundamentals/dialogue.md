#### Dialogue

> ℹ️ This section includes no dialogue mods by Von Django. This is because they were made with less than ideal dialogue editing methods, leading to unnecessary conflicts.

[**FMI - NotAllDunmer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47569)\
Improves idle dialogue filtering so that not all Dunmer refer to themselves as slavers, and not all Argonians refer to themselves as slaves.

[**Greetings for No Lore**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46063)\
Replaces the three standard No Lore greetings with over sixty new ones, adding variety to dialogue.

[**Outfit Greetings Tweaked**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46066)\
Greetings regarding clothes are limited to clothiers, nobles and snooty High Elves.
