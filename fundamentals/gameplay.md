Slows all creatures, NPCs and the Player down when they are walking half-submerged in water.

Adds extra service refusal dialogue once you progress further into the main quest. Any member of the Tribunal Temple and House Redoran will refuse to offer you their services as long as the persecution of the Nerevarine is still going on, or in the case of the Redoran, until you become their Hortator.

[**Class-Conscious Character Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48110)\
