# SHADERS

⭐ [**Pixel Shader Style Water for MGE XE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50044)\
A modernized version of the pixel shader water from vanilla Morrowind, which aims to replicate the texture, transparency, and artistic feeling of the original mercurial water, without duplicating its low resolution.

⭐ [**MGE XE Shader Pack**](https://github.com/Sigourn/morrowind-sharprepository/blob/main/MGE%20XE%20Shader%20Pack.7z)\
A compilation of a handful of community-made shaders.

* On MO2 installation, check the following options in the BAIN installer:
  * [x] 00 Core

Note that all of these shaders, minus the ones added by mods and which thus won't work without them enabled, are optional. In particular, **Special Process** tends to be divisive.
