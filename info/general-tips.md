## IN-GAME CONFIGURATION

It's time to finally run Morrowind.

* In Mod Organizer 2, click on the executables dropdown menu to the left of the **Run** button, and select **Morrowind**.
* Click **Run** to run the executable.

{% hint style="info" %}
Always remember to run Morrowind through Mod Organizer 2 to detect the Virtual Files folder.
{% endhint %}

* Once the game has finished loading, click **Options** and click the **Video** tab.
* The **Gamma Correction** slider lets you increase/decrease the brightness of your game. I like to play Morrowind with the slider roughly 40-45% of the way from left to right, making the game look less washed out.
* Turn the **Real-time Shadows** slider all the way to the left, disabling them. Morrowind's shadows are buggy, ugly, and are not worth the performance hit.
* Turn the **View Distance** slider all the way to the right, maximizing render distance for actors and other statics.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your game crashes when trying to access the **Video** tab, it may be because you are running Morrowind at a resolution unsupported by the game.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You should not adjust your resolution through the **Video** tab, as it will crash the game. Instead, run **MGE XE** and adjust it there.

## GENERAL TIPS

### Modding tips

The following aren't strict rules, but tips to follow if you are new to modding Morrowind.

* Always keep backup saves, particularly so when uninstalling or installing mods.
* Read mod descriptions. They usually list requirements, compatibility with other mods, and known issues. User comments can also list issues and possible fixes, but take these with a grain of salt. Many users erroneously claim a mod isn't working, because of end user mistakes.
* Don't uninstall or install mods mid-playthrough, unless you know for sure you can do it safely. Mod descriptions and user comments can help you out here.
* Learn how file structure works. Incorrect file structure means mods will not work as intended.
* Register BSA files when appropriate. BSA files contain data files for the mod you are installing, or for other mods to use as a resource. Failing to register your BSA files can cause [**yellow exclamation triangles**](https://external-preview.redd.it/dl-I4l\_Pzm5autet-87p1hnU1btUavtiu1mtwGzWBko.png?width=960\&crop=smart\&auto=webp\&s=3d180a6476cad80c332c12be08252511a0044c5c). This can also happen when a mod you are installing is missing assets.

To register a BSA file, launch Wrye Mash from Mod Organizer 2. In the **Mods** tab, click the **BSA Archives** tab to the right, and check the BSA you want to register.
